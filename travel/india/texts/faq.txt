<STRONG>Q. Do you sell your pictures? <BR>A.</STRONG> 
Yes. 



                          

Pictures will be delivered electronically (so 
that you can arrange for your own printing) either on CD (for a large number), or made available for 
you to download. <br>A fast connection is essential if you plan to download the 
image file. <br><br>
 
The cost for the image is:<br>
$ 50  for private use, 
<br>With a 20% discount if you buy two or more pictures at one 
time. <br>             
Or <br>
$100  when licensed for commercial / business use (more details of the licence available on request)
<br>With a 20% discount if you buy two or more 
pictures at one time. <br> <br>            


<br>What I need to know is which specific picture or pictures interests you, tell me the file name, and the size 
that you plan to have it printed, just tell me the length of the longest side. 
The final picture will retain optimum quality if it is prepared at source for 
printing at a specific size. <br><br>                                                       
                                   

<STRONG>If you live in Israel, </STRONG>I am ready to monitor the printing and send you the printed picrure, optionally monunted on a toughned foam board and/or framed. I will charge a nominal fee for the work, and do it in one of the well known high quality studios in Tel Aviv. 
<br>Printed images (specify if you want 
it glossy or matt, mounted or framed): <br>

Payments are accepted from Israel by cheque.<br>
Payments are accepted from the rest of the world by US$ Checks .

The pictures presented on the web are low 
resolution versions. For every low res picture on the site there is a high res 
version. Most of the pictures on file will print large, up to poster size, but a 
few would need to be limited to smaller size where the original image has been 
heavily cropped. Pictures supplied are in 8 bit&nbsp;JPG format with a colour 
pallet of sRGB at a resolution of 300 dots per inch.

<p><strong>Q. What sort of camera should I buy? 
<br>

       
A.</strong> To quote Graham Jeffrey, who is my authority on those matters:"I don't know."
</p>
<p><strong>Q. How did you build your site? <br>

      
A.</strong> Amit Friedman (the husband of Hadas my 
daughter) built it for me, based on SensitiveLight a web site which I found most 
simply and effectively designed. It is the site of a wonderful English 
photographer named Graham Jeffery who lives in Hinckley, somewhere in middle 
England - <a href="http://sensitivelight.com" target="_blank">http://sensitivelight.com</a>                                                  .
</p>
<p><strong>Q. Who hosts your site? <br>
    
A.</strong> India Images is hosted by&nbsp;_____ and 
their service is excellent. Uri Raz helped me get the hosting services, and 
escorted me and Amit along the way, many thanks to him. <a href="">(site of 
Uri...)</a>
