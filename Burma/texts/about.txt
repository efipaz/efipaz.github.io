My first camera was a "Kodak" box my father brought from Belgium and my first shots were done in "Gan Haatzmaaut" looking over the Tel Aviv beach. I was doing industry and nature photography in Ein Gedi Photographic Workshop, which specialized in professional photography and wall mural enlargements. <br>

After  leaving the Kibbutz and the workshop, I had a major problem, after becoming used to control my color prints in the sophisticated lab. I used my camera very little until the arrival of digital photography and its image processing capablities.

At the beginning of 2005, me and my wife Eti went to India for a year long trip. All this time Eti wrote a Blog diary which the Hebrew readers can see in another space in the site, while I was trying to document everything with my digital camera. For the better part of the trip I used my Olympus C700UZ, and in Chennai I  replaced it with an Olympus C8080WZ, since the 700 had a lens problem.
